# Welcome to our Micro Game Jam
In this Event we collaboratively create a Wario-ware-esque Game consisting of many Mini-Games.
You can find an example level in the `levels`-folder.
This framework defines 6 Actions:
  - Movement via WASD
  - Key 1 (Space Key)
  - Key 2 (Enter Key)


Each level goes into its own folder.

After you created your level, also add the scene to the levels-array in `gamemanager`.

You can submit your game via pull request after you are done.

## This is a work in Progess

Even this framework itself will be refined over the coming days.
